## This folder contains the following:

### 12 subfolders
Each subfolder is named after the corresponding parish, each containing scans and texts for the parishes, from which one or more minutes have been transcribed.
- Each parish-subfolder contains one or more annual subfolders, each of which contains a single pdf-file and a single txt-file.
- The multipage pdf-file contains the scanned images of all the transcribed minutes from that year, plus extra plain text-pages for easy readability.
- The txt-file contains the text from all the transcribed minutes from that year.

Note:
- Not all records from years 1940 to 1945 are transcribed for all parishes.
- Some years are not complete. In that case, the corresponding file has been marked with parentheses containing a month either marking the beginining or the end of the parish record.
- Some files might contain a considerable amount of noise due to incomplete transcribing. If that is the case, the file is also marked with a note in parentheses.
