# Datasets
This is the home for some of our curated datasets. Most of the datasets are saved as a [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) with the following content:

* A single "datapackage.json"-file that describes the structure and contents of the package
* One or more csv-files that constitute the contents of the package

## License
All datasets are published under a [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) v1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/).

## Citation
A CITATION.cff file is included for the automatic generation of BibTeX and APA-style citation.

Due to the structure of the collection (including diverging datasets in one repository), we are limited to a single generic citation file. Therefore we would greatly appreciate it, if you add the name(s) of the specific datasets, that you have used, to the automatically generated citation. A couple of APA-styled examples.

- If you have used the censuses from the years 1787 and 1801, final citation should look like this:

  *Aarhus City Archives. (2021). Aarhus City Archives Online Datasets (version 2ec5655). Censuses 1787 and 1801*
  
- If you have used the City Council Minutes from 1915 through 1940, final citation should look like this:

  *Aarhus City Archives. (2021). Aarhus City Archives Online Datasets (version 2ec5655). City Council Minutes 1915-1940*
